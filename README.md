## Known issues

- If you want to search forms of a pokemon, such as galarian, alolan or female, must put a `-` between the name and the form name;

Ex: galarian ponyta: use ponyta-galar
Ex: alolan raichu: use raichu-alola
Ex: nidoran: use nidoran-f for female nidoran / use nidoran-m for male 

- If the name of the pokemon has especial character, as in farfetch`d, remove it for search..

Ex: farfetch`d: use farfetchd
